/**
 * Turns probe observations into a multi-axis [Diagnosis].
 *
 * Each rule is one piece of evidence with a weight, pushing one axis toward YES or NO. Weights on
 * the same side combine as independent evidence (1 - Π(1 - w)), so two weak signals make a strong
 * one but no pile of weak ones reaches certainty. An axis is decided only past [DECIDE] and with a
 * clear margin over the other side; otherwise it stays UNKNOWN -- a valid answer, which tells the
 * engine to gather more evidence (usually: try a foreign route) instead of guessing.
 *
 * The single most important property: a bare HTTP 403 is weak (0.2) evidence of a geo block.
 * It can be a WAF, a bot check or a login wall; it takes the service's own words (a region
 * signature) and/or a foreign route succeeding where the local one was refused.
