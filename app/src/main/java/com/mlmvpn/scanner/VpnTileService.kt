/**
 * The app's one Quick Settings tile.
 *
 * There were two, and neither could be right. One only knew about the Xray family and one only
 * about the five transports, so from the shade the user was asked to remember which of the app's
 * two VPN services had been carrying their traffic and pick the matching tile -- and picking the
 * wrong one did nothing they could see, because each tile reported the state of a service the
 * other one was running. One of them was also still labelled "NetDoctor", the name of the project
 * the transport stack came from, so the pair read as two unrelated apps.
 *
 * One tile, and it works out the answer itself:
 *
 *  - **Something is up** -> stop it, whichever service holds it.
 *  - **A transport was last used** -> bring that transport back.
 *  - **A special engine was last used** (Aether, VPN Gate, the anti-sanction relay, the game
 *    booster, a Quick Connect server) -> replay exactly that, because the engine's identity is
 *    in the URI and re-racing a list would connect to something else entirely.
 *  - **A config from the user's own list was last used** -> race the most recent N of them and
 *    take the fastest. N is Settings > Advanced VPN > Quick-connect servers, default 20. This is
 *    the one case where replaying the same entry is the wrong move: the list is the user's own
 *    and the point of the tile is to land on whichever of them is working right now.
 *  - **Nothing was ever connected and there are no configs** -- a fresh install -> walk the
 *    transports, Psiphon first, until one is actually carrying traffic. See [EngineLadder].
 *  - **Nothing was ever connected but configs exist** -> race them, as the best available guess.
 *
 * See [LastEngine] for how "last used" is recorded -- on CONNECTED, never on an attempt.
